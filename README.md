# CalorieTracker
A group project for the MSSA program. License for future branches may change. Not a complete application.
This application uses a web api (not included) to search the USDA database for calories in the food you want to search.

This is only a starting point and not meant to be a complete application.

# Apache Cordova
Uses vanilla JavaScript for the application.
